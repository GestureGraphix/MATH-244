\section*{Section 1.5 Problem 5}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem 1}

\qs{}{
  Prove the associativity of composing relations: If $R$, $S$, and $T$ are relations such that 
  $( R \circ S) \circ T$ is well defined, then $R \circ (S \circ T)$ is well defined and equal to $( R \circ S) \circ T$.
}


\begin{RemarkWithLily}{For prob 1}
  WWe know that $(w,z)$ lies in $(R \circ S) \circ T$ \textit{iff} there is some $y$ such that 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1] $(w,y) \in R \circ S$, and 
    \item [2] $(y,z) \in T$. 
  \end{itemize}

  Since $(w, y) \in R \circ S$, there is some $x$ such that 

  \[ (w,x) \in R \quad \text{and} \quad (x,y) \in S. \]

  Since we also have $(y,z) \in T$, it follows that $(x, z) \in S \circ T$. 

  So, we now have $(w,x) \in R$ and $(x,z) \in S \circ T$, which means that $(w,z) \in R \circ (S \circ T)$. 

  This means  
  \[ (R \circ S) \circ T \subseteq R \circ (S \circ T). \]

  Now, for the reverse inclusion, suppose $(w,z) \in R \circ (S \circ T)$. Then there exists some $x$ such that 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1] $(w,x) \in R$, and 
    \item [2] $(x,z) \in S \circ T$. 
  \end{itemize}

  Since $(x, z) \in S \circ T$, there is some $y$ such that 

  \[ (x,y) \in S \quad \text{and} \quad (y,z) \in T. \]

  Since $(w,x) \in R$ and $(x,y) \in S$, we conclude that $(w,y) \in R \circ S$. 

  Since we also have $(y,z) \in T$, it follows that $(w,z) \in (R \circ S) \circ T$. \\ 
   
  So 
  \[ R \circ (S \circ T) \subseteq (R \circ S) \circ T. \]

  So  
  \[ (R \circ S) \circ T = R \circ (S \circ T). \]

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem 2}

\qs{}{
  Prove that a relation $R$ is transitive if and only if $R \circ R \subseteq R$.
}

\begin{keyideaWithLotus}
  We need to show 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\Rightarrow$] If $R$ is transitive, then, $R \circ R \subseteq R$
    \item [$\Leftarrow$] If $R \circ R \subseteq R$, then $R$ is transitive.   
  \end{itemize}

\end{keyideaWithLotus}

\begin{RemarkWithLily}{$\Rightarrow$}
  WWe assume that $R$ is transitive. \\
  By def or relational composition we know that for a pair $(a,c) \in R \circ R$ there exists some $b$ $s.t.$ 

  \[ (a,b) \in R \quad \text{and} \quad (b,c) \in R \]

  Since $(a,b) \in R$ and $(b,c) \in R$, and $R$ is transitive
  \[ (a,c) \in R \]
  
  So every pair in $R \circ R \subseteq R$   
\end{RemarkWithLily}

\begin{RemarkWithLily}{$\Leftarrow$}
  WWe asume $R \circ R \subseteq R$ \\
  $R$ is transitive \textit{iff} for all $a,b,c$ 
  \[ (a,b) \in R \quad \text{and} \quad (b,c) \in R \]
  so, 
  \[ (a,c) \in R \]
  Now we suppose $(a,b) \in R $ and $(b,c)$ in R which would make $b$ the intermediate element so 
  \[ (a,c) \in R \circ R \]
  from our assumption any pair in $R \circ R$ has to be in $R$
  \[ (a,c) \in R \]

\section*{Section 1.6 Problem 6}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Problem 3}

\qs{}{
  Describe all relations on a set $X$ that are equivalences and orderings at the same time. 
}


\begin{RemarkWithLily}{For Prob 3}
  FFor this to be the case reflexivity and transitivity are required but for equivalence symmetry is required while for 
  ordering antisymmetry is required.    
  \bigskip 
  IF $R$ is symmetric and antisymmetric, for any $x,y \in X$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1] $xRy$ and $yRx$ for symmetry 
    \item [2] $=y$ for antisymmetry
  \end{itemize}                    
  Meaning that if $xRy$ holds than $x$ and $y$ have to be the same element. So really the relation is relating an element 
  to itself

\subsection*{Prob 4.b}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Prob 4.b}

\begin{keyideaWithLotus}
  We want to show that if \((X, \leq)\) and \((Y, \preceq)\) are two linearly ordered sets with \(n\) elements, then they must be isomorphic.
\end{keyideaWithLotus}

\begin{basecaseWithPoppy}
  \(n = 1\)

  If \(X\) and \(Y\) both have exactly one element, say \(X = \{x\}\) and \(Y = \{y\}\), we can define the function 
  \[
  f(x) = y.
  \]
  This is clearly a bijection (since both sets have only one element), and there is no ordering to worry about. Since order is trivially preserved, \(X\) and \(Y\) are isomorphic.
\end{basecaseWithPoppy}

\begin{inducthypWithRose}
  Assume that for any two linearly ordered sets with \(n-1\) elements, there exists an order-preserving bijection (an isomorphism) between them.
\end{inducthypWithRose}

\begin{inductstepWithTulip}

  Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are two linearly ordered sets with \(n\) elements. Since the order is total, each set has a unique largest element. Let
  \[
  x_{\text{max}} = \text{largest element of } X, \quad y_{\text{max}} = \text{largest element of } Y.
  \]
  
  Now, consider the subsets
  \[
  X' = X \setminus \{x_{\text{max}}\}, \quad Y' = Y \setminus \{y_{\text{max}}\}.
  \]
  These are both linearly ordered sets with \(n-1\) elements. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists an isomorphism 
  \[
  g: X' \to Y'.
  \]

  Next, we build a function \(f: X \to Y\) by setting
  \[
  f(x)=
  \begin{cases}
  g(x) & \text{if } x \in X',\\[1mm]
  y_{\text{max}} & \text{if } x = x_{\text{max}}.
  \end{cases}
  \]

  Let's check that \(f\) works:
  Since \(g\) is a bijection from \(X'\) to \(Y'\) and \(y_{\text{max}}\) is not in the image of \(g\), the function \(f\) is one-to-one and onto.

  \bigskip

  If both \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are in \(X'\), then \(f(x_1)=g(x_1)\) and \(f(x_2)=g(x_2)\), and since \(g\) is order preserving, the order is maintained.
  If \(x_1 \in X'\) and \(x_2 = x_{\text{max}}\), then in \(X\) we have \(x_1 \leq x_{\text{max}}\). In \(Y\), since \(y_{\text{max}}\) is the largest, \(g(x_1) \preceq y_{\text{max}}\), so the order is preserved.
  The case where \(x_1 = x_{\text{max}}\) and \(x_2 \in X'\) cannot happen because the largest element cannot be less than any other element.
  Finally, if both \(x_1 = x_{\text{max}}\) and \(x_2 = x_{\text{max}}\), the order obviously holds.

  \bigskip

  Since \(f\) is a bijection and it preserves the order, it is an isomorphism. 

  \medskip

  By the principle of induction, the claim holds for all \(n\).

\begin{RemarkWithLily}{Prob 5.b}
  AA chain in $2^{\{1, 2, \ldots n\}}$ would be a collection of subsets $S_{1} \subset S_{2} \subset \ldots \subset  S_{k}$
  If two distinct subsets have the same number of elements, then none could be a proper subset of the other. So the sizes of subsequent subsets must be strictly increasing.  

  \bigskip 
  Since any subset of \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\) has a cardinality between \(0\) and \(n\), there can be at most \(n+1\) different cardinalities. 
  
  \bigskip
    
  A chain with \(n+1\) elements is given by
  \[
  \varnothing \subset \{a_1\} \subset \{a_1, a_2\} \subset \cdots \subset \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\},
  \]
  where \(\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\} = \{1,2,\dots,n\}\) . This chain clearly has exactly one subset for each possible size from \(0\) to \(n\), showing that the maximum possible size \(n+1\) is attainable.
