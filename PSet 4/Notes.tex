\section*{3.2 Prob 1}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3.2 Prob 1}

\qs{}{
  How many permutations of \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\) have a single cycle?
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  There are \( n! \) ways to arrange \( n \) distinct elements in a sequence. Any sequence
  \[
  (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)
  \]
  can be thought of as a candidate for an \( n \)-cycle when interpreted in cyclic notation as
  \[
  (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n).
  \]
  
  But we can't count cycles where the order is simply rotated cyclically
  \[
  (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)
  \]
  is the same as the cycle
  \[
  (a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n, a_1),
  \]
  there are exactly \( n \) different ways to write the same cycle by cyclically rotating the elements. \\
  
  If we count every sequence as a distinct cycle, we overcount each \( n \)-cycle \( n \) times. \\
    
  To deal with the overcounting we divide the total number of sequences by \( n \). 
  \[
  \frac{n!}{n} = (n-1)!.
  \]

\qs{}{
  For a permutation \( p: X \to X \), let \( p^k \) denote the permutation arising by a \( k \)-fold 
  composition of \( p \), i.e., \( p^1 = p \) and \( p^k = p \circ p^{k-1} \). Define a relation 
  \( \approx \) on the set \( X \) as follows: \( i \approx j \) if and only if there exists a 
  \( k \geq 1 \) such that \( p^k(i) = j \). Prove that \( \approx \) is an equivalence relation 
  on \( X \), and that its classes are the cycles of \( p \).
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  Want to show that \( \approx \) satisfies the three properties of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

  \medskip
    
  For any \( i \in X \), since \( p \) is a permutation meaning its bijective, \( i \) must belong to some cycle. So, there exists a smallest positive integer \( k \geq 1 \) such that
  \[ p^k(i) = i. \]
  By the definition of \( \approx \), we have \( i \approx i \). So, \( \approx \) is reflexive.
  
  \medskip

  Suppose \( i \approx j \). Then there exists an integer \( k \geq 1 \) such that
  \[ p^k(i) = j. \]
  Since \( p \) is a permutation, it has an inverse \( p^{-1} \). Applying \( p^{-k} \) to both sides, we get
  \[ i = p^{-k}(j). \]
  Since this is also a permutation, there exists some positive integer \( m \) such that \( p^m(j) = i \). Thus, \( j \approx i \), showing that \( \approx \) is symmetric.
  
  \medskip 

  Suppose \( i \approx j \) and \( j \approx k \). Then there exist positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that
  \[ p^m(i) = j \quad \text{and} \quad p^n(j) = k. \]
  Now, consider the composition:
  \[ p^{m+n}(i) = p^n(p^m(i)) = p^n(j) = k. \]
  Since \( m+n \geq 1 \), it follows that \( i \approx k \). So, \( \approx \) is transitive.
  
  \bigskip   

  In cycle notation, the cycle containing an element \( i \) is defined as:
  \[\{ i,\, p(i),\, p^2(i),\, \ldots,\, p^{k-1}(i) \}, \]
  where \( k \) is the smallest positive integer such that \( p^k(i) = i \). 

  \bigskip
  
  By our definition of \( \approx \), an element \( j \in X \) is related to \( i \) if and only if there exists some \( k \geq 1 \) such that \( p^k(i) = j \). 
  This is exactly the description of the cycle of \( i \). So, the equivalence 
  class of \( i \) under \( \approx \) is precisely the set of all elements that 
  can be reached from \( i \) by some power of \( p \), which corresponds to the 
  cycle of \( i \).

\section*{3.3 Prob 7}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{3.3 Prob 7}

\qs{}{
  How many functions \( f: \{1,2, \dots, n\} \to \{1,2, \dots, n\} \) are there 
  that are \textit{monotonic}; that is, for \( i < j \) we have \( f(i) \leq f(j) \)? 
  \textit{The textbook has a hint to this problem in the back.}
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus} 
  A monotonic function 
  \[
  f: \{1,2,\dots,n\} \to \{1,2,\dots,n\}
  \]
  satisfies 
  \[
  f(1) \le f(2) \le \cdots \le f(n).
  \]
  So, the function is completely determined by the non-decreasing sequence 
  \[
  (f(1), f(2), \dots, f(n)),
  \]
  where each \( f(i) \) is in \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\).
  
  Define \(x_k\) as the number of times the value \(k\) appears in the sequence. Then we have
  \[
  x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n = n, \quad \text{with} \quad x_k \geq 0.
  \]
  The number of solutions to this equation in nonnegative integers is given by the stars and bars formula:
  \[
  \binom{n + n - 1}{n - 1} = \binom{2n-1}{n-1}.
  \]

  (optional bonus problem) Draw a triangle \( ABC \). Draw \( n \) points lying on the side \( AB \) (but different from \( A \) and \( B \)) and connect them all by segments to the vertex \( C \). Similarly, draw \( n \) points on the side \( AC \) and connect them to \( B \).
    
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How many intersections of the drawn segments are there? Into how many regions is the triangle \( ABC \) partitioned by the drawn segments?

  (Sieve of Eratosthenes) How many numbers are left in the set 
  \(\{1,2,\dots,1000\}\) after all multiples of 2, 3, 5, and 7
  are crossed out?

\begin{RemarkWithLily}{For Prob 4}
  DDefine:

  \begin{itemize}
      \item \(A_2\) as the set of multiples of 2,
      \item \(A_3\) as the set of multiples of 3,

  We want the size of the complement of \(A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_5 \cup A_7\)
  
  We cound the multiples of \(2,3,5,7 \) in the range of [1,1000].

  \[
  |A_2| = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{2} \right\rfloor = 500, \quad 
  |A_3| = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{3} \right\rfloor = 333, \quad

  |A_5 \cap A_7| = \left\lfloor \frac{1000}{35} \right\rfloor = 28.

  Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle
  
  The count of numbers divisible by at least one of \(2,3,5,7\) is:
  
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  |A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_5 \cup A_7| &= |A_2|+|A_3|+|A_5|+|A_7| \\

  &\quad + (33 + 23 + 14 + 9) \\
  &\quad - 4.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  
  \[
  \begin{aligned}

  166+100+71+66+47+28 &= 478, \\
  33+23+14+9 &= 79.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  
  \[
  |A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_5 \cup A_7| = 1175 - 478 + 79 - 4.
  \]
  
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  1175 - 478 &= 697, \quad 
  697 + 79 &= 776, \quad
  776 - 4 &= 772.
  \end{aligned}

  The count of numbers \textbf{not} divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 is:
  \[
  1000 - 772 = 228.

\qs{}{
  Prove the equation
    \[
    D(n) = n! - nD(n-1) - \binom{n}{2} D(n-2) - \dots - \binom{n}{n-1} D(1) - 1.
    \]
}

\begin{proofWithHibiscus}
  Suppose a permutation of \(\{1,2,\dots,n\}\) has exactly \(i\) fixed points. 
  There are \(\binom{n}{i}\) ways to choose these fixed points. 
  The remaining \(n-i\) elements must form a derangement, which can be done in \(D(n-i)\) ways.

  \medskip 

  Therefore, the total number of permutations of \(n\) elements can be written as
  \[
  \sum_{i=0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} D(n-i) = n!.
  \]
  
  \bigskip

  Let \(j=n-i\). Then as \(i\) runs from 0 to \(n\), so does \(j\). Since the binomial coefficient is symmetric
  \[
  \sum_{j=0}^{n} \binom{n}{j} D(j) = n!.
  \]
  
  Expanding
  \[
  \binom{n}{0}D(0)+\binom{n}{1}D(1)+\cdots+\binom{n}{n-1}D(n-1)+\binom{n}{n}D(n) = n!.
  \]
  
  Since \(\binom{n}{0} = 1\) and \(\binom{n}{n} = 1\), and \(D(0)=1\), we have:
  \[
  1 \cdot 1 + \binom{n}{1}D(1)+\cdots+\binom{n}{n-1}D(n-1) + 1 \cdot D(n) = n!.
  \]
  
  \bigskip
  
  Solve for \(D(n)\) by subtractracting the contributions of \(D(0), D(1), \dots, D(n-1)\) from both sides:
  \[
  D(n) = n! - \left[\binom{n}{1}D(1)+\binom{n}{2}D(2)+\cdots+\binom{n}{n-1}D(n-1)+ \binom{n}{0}D(0)\right].
  \]
  
  Since \(\binom{n}{0}D(0)=1\)
  \[
  D(n) = n! - \binom{n}{1}D(n-1) - \binom{n}{2}D(n-2) - \dots - \binom{n}{n-1}D(1) - 1.
  \]
